# Sinkhorn Algorithm

This is a simple implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm using c++, openmp and dlib. It was created for an academic project of the ENPC.

## Build

If you don't have openmp you should install it first !
This project uses CMake. To compile it, follow the instructions:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
## Documentation

Several options are possible, to list them just type:
